\chapter*{Abstract}
This bibliography style has been developed solely to meet the demands of the UniSA-Harvard referencing system as laid out in the January 2017 edition of the \emph{Harvard Referencing Guide UniSA}. It is not intended to be configurable, and as \LaTeX{} code it is pretty hacky, but aside from the caveats noted in marginal comments it appears to meet the reference requirements for those formats which are implemented.

Citations are not yet working correctly.
\show\todo
\todo{Support automatic citation of page numbers where only one page is in the source.}

This document is both an example of the use of the reference style (allowing comparison to the official specification), and a set of test cases for semi-manual regression testing.





\chapter*{Disclaimer}
The \biblatex{} BBX code is principally my own work, although it draws from the examples given in the \biblatex{} documentation and elsewhere. The sample text is drawn almost verbatim from \citetitle{UniSA-HRG}. The CBX code is as-yet largely from \biblatex.

\chapter{Usage}
To produce your bibliography, you need to run latex, then biber, then latex, just like when using bibtex.
For example:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
	xelatex your_file
	biber your_file
	xelatex your_file
\end{lstlisting}

It requires e-\TeX, that is, almost any modern \TeX{} engine. 
It has been tested in Xe\LaTeX{} and PDF\LaTeX. 
It also requires an MD5 command, and if it isn't called \verb|\mdfivesum| or \verb|\pdfmdfivesum| you'll need to add \verb|\let\mdfivesum\yourmdfivesum| to your preamble.

\chapter{An extract from an essay using the Harvard referencing system}
\begin{refsection}
\textelp{} The literal adaptation of a book to film is practically impossible. As \textcite[4]{Stam2005} suggests:
\blockquote{The shift from a single-track verbal medium such as the novel to a multi-track medium like film, which can play not only with words (written and spoken) but also with music, sound effects, and moving photographic images, explains the unlikelihood and \textelp{} undesirability of literal fidelity.}
It is puzzling, then, that readers and audiences are so critical of adaptations which take liberties, sometimes for the better, with their source material.

Film adaptations of novels are frequently 
\blockquote[{\parencite[15]{Stam2005a}}]{castigated and held to an absurdly rigorous standard of fidelity}. 
If key scenes from a novel are pruned for film, audiences often react negatively. However, fidelity is not an appropriate measure for evaluating a film adaptation’s success, as numerous scholars concur \parencite{Desmond2006,Leitch2008,McFarlane1996,Miller2004}. Judging film adaptations is ultimately, \textcite[9]{Whelehan1999} contends, ‘an inexact science dogged by value judgments about the relative artistic worth of literature and film’. A fan of a novel might denigrate a film adaptation which alters the original book in some fashion, but their response is highly subjective and fails to take into account the practices and realities of film production \parencite[26]{McFarlane2007}.

Sometimes there are grounds for hostility. Author Alan Moore has witnessed a number of his complex graphic novels adapted into shallow Hollywood products, making him extremely critical of filmmakers and the filmmaking process \parencite{Ahsurst2009}. However, this kind of attitude can be knee-jerk and reactionary. Rather than being overly pedantic about textual faithfulness, it is best to approach film adaptations as re-interpretations of their source material \parencite[8]{Hutcheon2006} or as 
\textquote[(\citeauthor{Kristeva1995} cited in \cite{Sanders2006})]{a permutation of text, an intertextuality}. % needs to make pag enumber work eg (Kristeva, cited in Sanders 2006, p. 2)
Moreover, new modes of production further complicate existing definitions of, and approaches to, adaptation \parencite[180]{Moore2010}. So\textelp{}
